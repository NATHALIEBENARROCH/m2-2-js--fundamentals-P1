//////HELP HELP HELP
// Q7 (STRETCH)

// `secret` is an encrypted message! Let's see if we can figure out what it
// says. To decode the message, you'll need to remove any words that are found
// in the "notCode" array.
//
// For example:
//   IF secret was `bluehired`
//   AND notCode was `['blue', 'red']`
//   THEN the answer would be `hi` (bluehired without blue and red).
