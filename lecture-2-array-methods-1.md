# 2.2.2 - JavaScript Array methods P1

---

- Arrays have a bunch of methods attached to them.
- Many of which you'll use on a daily basis.

---

## Common Array methods

- `.concat()`
- `.join()`

---

### [`.concat()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_concat_array.asp)

The `.concat()` method returns a _new_ array with the values of two existing arrays.

```js
// Example
const arrayOne = ["think", "dream", "learn", "write"];
const arrayTwo = ["thought", "dreams", "knowledge", "truth"];
let newArray = arrayOne.concat(arrayTwo);
console.log(newArray);
```

---

### [`.join()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_join.asp)

The `.join()` method returns the array as a string.

```js
//  REVIEW
const lexicon = [
  "The",
  "large",
  "shaggy",
  "dog",
  "barked",
  "at",
  "the",
  "silence",
];

let sentence = lexicon.join();
```

---

And there are so many more.

## Exercise

Let's dip into the internet and see if we can learn all of these methods collectively.

1. `.includes()`, `.slice()`
2. `.indexOf()`, `.push()`
3. `.pop()`, `.sort()`
4. `.shift()`, `.unshift()`
5. `.reverse()`, `.lastIndexOf()`
6. `.splice()`, `.toString()`

- Split into teams.
- Take given methods
  - find an explanation/definition, then write your own.
  - create two examples of each method in use. Be creative. ðŸ˜›
