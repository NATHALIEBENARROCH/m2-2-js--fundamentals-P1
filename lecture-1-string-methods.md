# 2.2.1 - JavaScript String Methods

---

## Methods

All data types in JS support methods.

Methods are properties that can be _called._

Methods can be _native_ (built into the language), or created by the programmer.

---

## .toString()

Every data type has a `toString` method.

Sometimes it's more useful than others.

---

## Common String Methods and Properties

Strings have a bunch of methods and properties that will be immediately useful. üòâ

- `.length`
- `.replace()`
- `.slice()`
- `.includes()`
- `split()`
- `indexOf()`

üìù None of these methods **mutate** the string; strings are **immutable**.
üìù They return a new version of the string which you can then work with as you like.

---

### [`.length`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_length_string.asp)

`.length` is a property that holds the # of characters in the string.

```js
// Example
const sentiment = "I love programming";
sentiment.length;
```

---

### [`.replace()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_replace.asp)

The `.replace()` method replaces a specified value with another value in a string.

It takes 2 parameters, the value to replace and the new value.

```js
// Example
const sentiment = "I love programming";
sentiment.replace("love", "adore");
```

---

### [`.slice()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_slice_string.asp)

`.slice()` extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

- The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position.

```js
// Example
const sentiment = "I love programming";
sentiment.slice(2, 6);
```

---

### [`.includes()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_includes.asp)

The `.includes()` method tells us if a string includes another string

```js
// Example
let sentence = "Let's have a pizza party!";
sentence.includes("pizza");
```

DONE

### [`.split()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_split.asp)

The `.split()` method "split" a string into an array of _substrings_.

```js
// Example
const truth = "The greatest teacher, failure is.";
truth.split(" ");
```

---

### [`.indexOf()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_indexof.asp)

The `.indexOf()` method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs.

````js
// Example
let yodaSpeak =
  'Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.';
yodaSpeak.indexOf("side");

_Why would JavaScript decide to return `-1` instead of some other value? like `0`?_
means cannot be found.

# Exercises

Turn an input string into another string

---
// REVIEW
```js
const input = 'I am a really long sentence, look how many words I have!';
let startingIndex = input.indexOf("sentence");
let endingIndex = input.indexOf("many");
input.slice(startingIndex,endingIndex);


// output: "sentence, look how"
const output = "sentence, look how"

---

const output = "### Let's do this in groups!"

We'll test the **breakout rooms** feature üòÄ

---
// HEEERE
```js
const input = 'Hi World';
const input = 'Hi World';
input.replace('Hi','Hello');

const input = 'I am a really long sentence, look how many words I have!';
let startingIndex = input.indexOf("sentence");
let endingIndex = input.indexOf("many");
input.slice(startingIndex,endingIndex);

// HEEERE
```js
const input = 'I am 23 years old!';
input.replace("23 years ",'');

// output: "I am old!"
````

<!-- IS THIS OK -->

````js
const input = "How are you today?";
input.replace("today", "yesterday");

// HOW TO DO THIS
// output: ["how", "are", "you", "yesterday?"]
```input.split(" ");
